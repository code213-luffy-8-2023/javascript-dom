#### **Understanding Events**

---

1. **What is an event?**

In the context of the DOM, an event is a signal that something has happened. This "something" can be caused by users' actions, like clicking on a button or pressing a key, or by the browser, like when a page finishes loading.

Examples of common events:
- **click**: When an element is clicked.
- **mouseover**: When the mouse pointer is moved onto an element.
- **keypress**: When a key is pressed down.

2. **How browsers detect and respond to events**

Browsers are always listening for events. When an event occurs, the browser creates an event object with details about the event (like which element was clicked or which key was pressed). It then checks if any functions (event listeners) have been set up to respond to that event on the target element and executes them.

#### **Adding Event Listeners**

---

1. **`addEventListener()`**

The `addEventListener()` method allows you to add event listeners on elements. 

*HTML:*
```html
<button id="clickMe">Click me!</button>
```

*JavaScript:*
```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('clickMe');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});
```

2. **Handling multiple events for a single element**

An element can have multiple event listeners, even for the same event type.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('First listener');
});

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Second listener');
});
```

3. **Event bubbling and delegation**

Event bubbling is a mechanism where an event on a child element propagates (bubbles) up to its parents. In the example bellow, clicking on a list item will also trigger the event listener on the list.

*HTML:*
```html
<ul id="itemList">
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

*JavaScript:*
```javascript
const itemList = document.getElementById('itemList');

itemList.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    alert(event.target.textContent + ' was clicked!');
});
```

#### **Removing Event Listeners**

---

1. **Importance of named functions for removal**

To remove an event listener using `removeEventListener()`, you must provide the exact function used when adding the listener. This is why named functions or saved references to anonymous functions are necessary.

*JavaScript:*
```javascript
function handleClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
}

// this event listener can not be removed because we used an anonymous function without saving a reference to it
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
    alert('This listener will not be removed.');
});

// this event listener can be removed because we used a named function that we can reference later
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// Later in the code...
button.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
```
