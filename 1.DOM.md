### **What is the DOM?**

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of a webpage that allows it to be manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript. Think of it as a tree of elements from the webpage.

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **DOM vs. Source Code**
   - The DOM is a live, structured representation of the page, whereas the source code is the raw HTML.
   - Even if the HTML is messy, the browser creates a structured DOM.

2. **Tree Structure**
   - The DOM is like a tree, where each part (node) can be an element, attribute, or text.
   - Example:

     ```
     <html>
     ├── <head>
     │   └── <title>My Title</title>
     └── <body>
         └── <h1>Hello World!</h1>
     ```

In javascript we can access the DOM using the `document` object. then we can all any method on it to manipulate the DOM.

Example:

```js
document.getElementById("myId");
document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
document.getElementsByTagName("p");
```
