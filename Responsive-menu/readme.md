### Responsive Top Menu Design Challenge

**Objective:** Design and implement a responsive top menu that functions seamlessly across devices. The menu should transition between a full horizontal menu for larger screens and a mobile-friendly dropdown menu activated by a "hamburger" icon on smaller screens.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create a navigation bar containing a list of menu items.
   - The menu items to include are: "Home", "About", "Services", "Portfolio", and "Contact".
   - Incorporate a "hamburger" icon to be displayed only on mobile or smaller screen sizes.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style the navigation bar to your liking, ensuring it is clean and professional.
   - Use CSS media queries to differentiate between larger screens and mobile views.
   - On larger screens:
     - Menu items should be displayed horizontally.
     - "Hamburger" icon should be hidden.
   - On mobile or smaller screens:
     - Menu items should be hidden initially.
     - "Hamburger" icon should be displayed. When clicked, it should reveal the menu items in a vertical dropdown format.
   - Add smooth transitions and effects for enhanced user experience.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Use vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries) to add interactivity to the "hamburger" icon.
   - When the "hamburger" icon is clicked, the menu items should either show (if currently hidden) or hide (if currently displayed).

**Bonus Points:**
- Enhance user experience with subtle hover effects on the menu items.
- Add an animation to the "hamburger" icon when transitioning between its normal state and its "active" state (e.g., transforming the three bars into an "X").
